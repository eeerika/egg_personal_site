      "contents": "\nInterests ~\nSome people have an idea about how they want to spend their life from\na very young age — a calling so-to-speak, beckoning them in a certain\ndirection. I’ve never been that way: almost everything interests me.\nI’ve always wanted to embrace all of my different passions and try to\nfind some way to make them all work together, which is exactly what I’ve\nbeen able to explore and formulate throughout my undergraduate\neducation. Next year, I hope to attend a Masters program that will help\nme translate my synthesis of interests to a more professional setting\nand enhance my confidence in solving complex technical problems.\nI gravitated toward the interdisciplinary field of Environmental\nStudies in my undergraduate studies, despite arriving undeclared.\nHowever, by the end of my second year, I, expectedly, felt there was\nstill more to explore, and decided to undertake two more majors in\nLinguistics and History of Art and Architecture. Through the three very\ndifferent, yet interconnected, lenses, I have been fostering a greater\npassion for computational data methods and opening my mind to a depth of\nissues in urbanism and sustainability. Without these different lenses, I\nwould feel much less prepared to help tackle the complex issues that\nexist in our society today. In graduate school and beyond, I would like\nto apply these lenses to analyzing urban-centered socio-environmental\ntopics, such as food insecurity, urban forestry, public health, noise\npollution, and city planning, improving the sustainability and equity of\ncities.\nExperience / major projects ~\nClick here for a pdf\nversion of my CV/resume including the below information plus\nmore!\nFAMST\n54: Hollywood Industry, Film and Media Studies Department, UCSB, Goleta,\nCA\nUndergraduate Teaching Assistant\nSeptember 2021-Present\nAssisting Professor Cheri Steinkellner with grading assignments,\nanswering student questions, and tasks during class lectures\nYour Children’s Trees,\nUCSB, Goleta, CA\nBoard Member (Treasurer)\nSeptember 2021-Present\nManaging spreadsheets of intern stipend allocations, applying for\ngrants, performing requisitions for funding, and completing various\nadministrative tasks to maintain registered student organization status,\nas well as discussing and voting on major board decisions with other\nboard members\nMarine\nScience Institute (MSI) Analytical Lab, UCSB, Goleta, CA\nStudent Lab Assistant\nApril 2021-Present\nPrepping researchers’ samples for CHN (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen) and\nmass spectrometry analysis (including checking in sample arrivals,\nacidifying samples, weighing samples) and assisting with lab upkeep\nNational\nCenter for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) Arctic Data Center\n(ADC), UCSB, Santa Barbara, CA\nData Management Intern\nJune 2020-Present\nUtilizing a keen attention to detail to organize, manage, and\narchive data from environmental research projects using RStudio\nCommunicating professionally with researchers via email to create an\naccurate representation of said data\nCollaborating with teammates to troubleshoot each others’ code and\nreview each others’ datasets\nAnalyzing the training guides for potential edits in protocol\nOccasionally helping to fix bugs within the ADC’s functions in\nR\nRegents Scholars\nAssociation, UCSB, Goleta, CA\nBoard Member\nMay 2020-Present\nPlanning events for other Regents Scholars, incorporating diverse\nfields of research as well as transitioning events effectively to a\nwell-attended online format during COVID-19\nFostering a welcoming, supportive environment in the club and acting\nas a resource for advice and information for members\nYour Children’s Trees,\nUCSB, Goleta, CA\nTree Care Intern\nApril 2021-September 2021\nPerforming maintenance on trees at urban locations in the SB and\nGoleta area in a large team\nMacDonald Lab, UCSB, Goleta,\nCA\nUndergraduate Research Assistant\nMarch 2021-August 2021\nUncovering intersections between the effects of COVID-19 and\nenvironmental factors through data analysis and synthesis with Google\nEarth Engine and R\nA\nVisual Narrative of Food Insecurity in Santa Barbara County: an\ninteractive geographic data visualization created during ENV S 195:\nEnvironmental Leadership Incubator, UCSB, Goleta, CA\nCo-Creator\nSeptember 2020-June 2021\nCollaborating to research and construct a map demonstrating\ncorrelations between poverty levels and other factors to aid the Santa\nBarbara Food Bank in determining viable new food distribution locations,\nand learning new software (Tableau) and troubleshooting along the way,\nconcluding in apresentation on our findings\nA\nDrop in the Sand: a 10-minute long animated short film created during\nFAMST 106: Crew Production, UCSB, Goleta, CA\nProducer and Colorist\nSeptember 2020-March 2021\nCo-leading a team of 30+ individuals to help manage production flow,\nour LLC, budgeting, fundraising (raising over $6000) and perk\nfulfillment, and social media presence for the film, as well as\nassisting with coloring numerous frames for the film in Toon Boom\nHarmony\nLING 20 and LING 117, UCSB,\nGoleta, CA\nUndergraduate Assistant\nSeptember 2020-December 2020\nAssisting Professor Kennedy with restructuring his quizzes and other\nassignments in LING 20 and LING 117 for clarity as he transitioned his\ncourses to better fit the atmosphere of online learning\nD’Antonio Lab, UCSB, Goleta,\nCA\nUndergraduate Research Assistant\nSeptember 2019-June 2020\nWorking in the field and lab on a project investigating chaparral\nrestoration into a degraded chaparral stand, assisting in the set-up of\nthe experimental plots, transplanting seedlings, monitoring seedlings\nfor survival and growth, and collecting environmental metrics of\nlandscape-scale and localized-scale plot characteristics, and entering\nthis data into Google Sheets\nLearning to analyze data using R\nSanta\nBarbara Coastal -
