I’ve never been that way: almost everything interests me.\nI’ve always wanted to embrace all of my different passions and try to\nfind some way to make them all work together, which is exactly what I’ve\nbeen able to explore and formulate throughout my undergraduate\neducation. I am now pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science in\nhopes of learning more about how to translate my synthesis of interests\nto a more professional setting and enhance my confidence in solving\ncomplex technical problems.\nI gravitated toward the interdisciplinary field of Environmental\nStudies in my undergraduate studies, despite arriving undeclared.\nHowever, by the end of my second year, I, expectedly, felt there was\nstill more to explore, and decided to undertake two more majors in\nLinguistics and History of Art and Architecture. Through the three very\ndifferent, yet interconnected, lenses, I have been fostering a greater\npassion for computational data methods and opening my mind to a depth of\nissues in urbanism and sustainability. Without these different lenses, I\nwould feel much less prepared to help tackle the complex issues that\nexist in our society today. In graduate school and beyond, I would like\nto apply these lenses to analyzing urban-centered socio-environmental\ntopics, such as food insecurity, urban forestry, public health, noise\npollution, and city planning, improving the sustainability and equity of\ncities.\n\n\n\n",
