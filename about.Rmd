### Interests ~

Some people have an idea about how they want to spend their life from a very young age — a calling so-to-speak, beckoning them in a certain direction. I’ve never been that way: almost everything interests me. I’ve always wanted to embrace all of my different passions and try to find some way to make them all work together, which is exactly what I’ve been able to explore and formulate throughout my undergraduate education. I am now pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science in hopes of learning more about how to translate my synthesis of interests to a more professional setting and enhance my confidence in solving complex technical problems.

I gravitated toward the interdisciplinary field of Environmental Studies in my undergraduate studies, despite arriving undeclared. However, by the end of my second year, I, expectedly, felt there was still more to explore, and decided to undertake two more majors in Linguistics and History of Art and Architecture. Through the three very different, yet interconnected, lenses, I have been fostering a greater passion for computational data methods and opening my mind to a depth of issues in urbanism and sustainability. Without these different lenses, I would feel much less prepared to help tackle the complex issues that exist in our society today. In graduate school and beyond, I would like to apply these lenses to analyzing urban-centered socio-environmental topics, such as food insecurity, urban forestry, public health, noise pollution, and city planning, improving the sustainability and equity of cities.
