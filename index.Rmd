Erika Egg currently aids with data management as an intern with the NCEAS Arctic Data Center as well as conducts sample prep for the MSI Analytical Lab. She has a deep interest in how data science and technology interact with a wide variety of fields. Accordingly, she is triple majoring in Environmental Studies, Linguistics (Emphasis in Speech and Language Technologies), and History of Art and Architecture (Emphasis in Architecture and Environment) at UCSB in hopes of gaining an educational background that can help her better understand the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the world. In graduate school, she hopes to build upon her skillset to use computational methods to analyze urban processes, including but not limited to any topics related to the environment, human dynamics, and sustainability.
