Erika Egg is a fourth year undergraduate triple majoring in Environmental Studies, Linguistics (Emphasis in Speech and Language Technologies), and History of Art and Architecture (Emphasis in Architecture and Environment) at UCSB. She hopes to acquire an educational background that can help her better understand the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the world as it applies to urban dynamics and sustainability. She currently aids with data management as an intern with the NCEAS Arctic Data Center as well as conducts sample prep for the MSI Analytical Lab. This coming Spring she will also be reprising her role as a TA for FAMST 54 at UCSB.
